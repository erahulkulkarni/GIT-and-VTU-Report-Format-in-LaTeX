\section*{Introduction}
This chapter covers assumptions made for parameters values to run simulations and format of files that save results of simulations.
Configuration file consists the setting values for which simulation has to be run, consisting of Fiber Threshold, FD, Doubling Time, 
Number of Simulation Steps, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\lambda$, $\alpha$, $\sigma$, $\mu$.


\section*{Parameter values and model assumptions}
Due to limited understanding of CSC dynamics and availability of only some of the experimental data, 
there are several assumptions made to construct the current version of the model. 

\section*{Conclusion}  
The .csv result file help in faster quantification when used with MATLAB$\circledR$. 
Only one single txt file is being used to save the entire state of CA which includes  FD, FS, cell types, remaining rounds of amplification of TAC and age of TDC.
This helps in quicker generation of images of biological equivalent state while reducing space requirements to save results.
